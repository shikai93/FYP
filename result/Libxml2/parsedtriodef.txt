Platform and compiler support detection

Workaround for old xlc

Workaround for old DEC C compilers

VMS is placed first to avoid identifying the platform as Unix based on the DECC compiler later on.

Generic defines

ANSI C

Workarounds

Computations done with constants at compile time can trigger these even when compiling with IEEE enabled.

Although the compiler supports C99 language constructs, the C run-time library does not contain all C99 functions. This was the case for 70300022. Update the 80000000 value when it has been accurately determined what version of the library supports C99.

Not all preprocessors supports the LL token.
