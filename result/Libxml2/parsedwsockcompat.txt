include/wsockcompat.h Windows -> Berkeley Sockets compatibility things.

the following is a workaround a problem for 'inline' keyword in said header when compiled with Borland C++ 6

Check if ws2tcpip.h is a recent version which provides getaddrinfo()

Include <errno.h> here to ensure that it doesn't get included later (e.g. by iconv.h) and overwrites the definition of EWOULDBLOCK.

These cause conflicts with the codes from errno.h. Since they are not used in the relevant code (nanoftp, nanohttp), we can leave them disabled. #define ENAMETOOLONG WSAENAMETOOLONG #define ENOTEMPTY WSAENOTEMPTY
