Summary: compile-time version informations on Windows Description: compile-time version informations for the XML library when compiled on the Windows platform Copy: See Copyright for the status of this software. Author: Daniel Veillard

use those to be sure nothing nasty will happen if your library and includes mismatch

LIBXML2_COMPILING_MSCCDEF

LIBXML_DOTTED_VERSION: the version string like "1.2.3"

LIBXML_VERSION: the version number: 1.2.3 value is 1002003

LIBXML_VERSION_STRING: the version number string, 1.2.3 value is "1002003"

LIBXML_TEST_VERSION: Macro to check that the libxml version in use is compatible with the version the software has been compiled against

WITH_TRIO: defined if the trio support need to be configured in

WITHOUT_TRIO: defined if the trio support should not be configured in

LIBXML_THREAD_ENABLED: Whether the thread support is configured in

LIBXML_FTP_ENABLED: Whether the FTP support is configured in

LIBXML_HTTP_ENABLED: Whether the HTTP support is configured in

LIBXML_HTML_ENABLED: Whether the HTML support is configured in

LIBXML_CATALOG_ENABLED: Whether the Catalog support is configured in

LIBXML_DOCB_ENABLED: Whether the SGML Docbook support is configured in

LIBXML_XPATH_ENABLED: Whether XPath is configured in

LIBXML_XPTR_ENABLED: Whether XPointer is configured in

LIBXML_C14N_ENABLED: Whether the Canonicalization support is configured in

LIBXML_XINCLUDE_ENABLED: Whether XInclude is configured in

LIBXML_ICONV_ENABLED: Whether iconv support is available

LIBXML_DEBUG_ENABLED: Whether Debugging module is configured in

DEBUG_MEMORY_LOCATION: Whether the memory debugging is configured in

LIBXML_DLL_IMPORT: Used on Windows (MS C compiler only) to declare a variable as imported from the library. This macro should be empty when compiling libxml itself. It should expand to __declspec(dllimport) when the client code includes this header, and that only if the client links dynamically against libxml. For this to work, we need three macros. One tells us which compiler is being used and luckily the compiler defines such a thing: _MSC_VER. The second macro tells us if we are compiling libxml or the client code and we define the macro IN_LIBXML on the compiler's command line for this purpose. The third macro, LIBXML_STATIC, must be defined by any client code which links against libxml statically.

ATTRIBUTE_UNUSED: Macro used to signal to GCC unused function parameters

#pragma comment(lib, "iconv.lib") pragma understood my MS compiler which enables a conditional link with iconv.
