This is the global mask for the mbstring functions: this is use to mask out certain types (such as BMPString and UTF8String) because certain software (e.g. Netscape) has problems with them.

This function sets the default to various "flavours" of configuration. based on an ASCII string. Currently this is: MASK:XXXX : a numerical mask value. nobmp : Don't use BMPStrings (just Printable, T61). pkix : PKIX recommendation in RFC2459. utf8only : only use UTF8Strings (RFC2459 recommendation for 2004). default: the default value, Printable, T61, BMP.

The following function generates an ASN1_STRING based on limits in a table. Frequently the types and length of an ASN1_STRING are restricted by a corresponding OID. For example certificates and certificate requests.

Now the tables and helper functions for the string table:

Return a string table pointer which can be modified: either directly from table or a copy of an internal value added to the table.

Always need a string table so allocate one if NULL
