XXX: probably some better way to do this

N.B. The IV for this mode is _twice_ the block size

Note that its effectively impossible to do biIGE in anything other than a single pass, so no provision is made for chaining.

N.B. The IV for this mode is _four times_ the block size

XXX: Do a separate case for when in != out (strictly should check for overlap, too)

First the forward pass

And now backwards

XXX: reduce copies by alternating between buffers
