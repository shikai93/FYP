If there is 0 or 1 byte left, the length check should pick things up

high-tag

Set this so that even if things are not long enough the values are set correctly

Decode a length field. The short form is a single byte defining a length 0 - 127. The long form is a byte 0 - 127 with the top bit set and this indicates the number of following octets that contain the length. These octets are stored most significant digit first.

Skip leading zeroes

class 0 is constructed constructed == 2 for indefinite length constructed

Copy flags but preserve embed value

an allowance for strings :-)
