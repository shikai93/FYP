AsyncBioCreate creates a filter BIO for testing asynchronous state

machines which consume a stream socket. Reads and writes will fail

and return EAGAIN unless explicitly allowed. Each async BIO has a

read quota and a write quota. Initially both are zero. As each is

incremented, bytes are allowed to flow through the BIO.

AsyncBioCreateDatagram creates a filter BIO for testing for

asynchronous state machines which consume datagram sockets. The read

and write quota count in packets rather than bytes.

AsyncBioAllowRead increments |bio|'s read quota by |count|.

AsyncBioAllowWrite increments |bio|'s write quota by |count|.

AsyncBioEnforceWriteQuota configures where |bio| enforces its write quota.
