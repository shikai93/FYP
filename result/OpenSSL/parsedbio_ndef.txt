Experimental NDEF ASN1 BIO support routines

The usage is quite simple, initialize an ASN1 structure, get a BIO from it then any data written through the BIO will end up translated to appropriate format on the fly. The data is streamed out and does not need to be all held in memory at once. When the BIO is flushed the output is finalized and any signatures etc written out. The BIO is a 'proper' BIO and can handle non blocking I/O correctly. The usage is simple. The implementation is not...

BIO support data stored in the ASN1 BIO ex_arg

ASN1 structure this BIO refers to

Top of the BIO chain

Output BIO

Boundary where content is inserted

DER buffer start

ASN1 bio needs to be next to output BIO

Now let callback prepends any digest, cipher etc BIOs ASN1 structure needs.
