Set that it's the last block we'll compress

Initialize the hashing state.

init2 xors IV with input parameter block

The param struct is carefully hand packed, and should be 32 bytes on every platform.

IV XOR ParamBlock

Initialize the hashing context. Always returns 1.

Permute the state while xoring in the block of data.

There are two distinct usage vectors for this function: a) BLAKE2s_Update uses it to process complete blocks, possibly more than one at a time; b) BLAK2s_Final uses it to process last block, always single but possibly incomplete, in which case caller pads input with zeros.

Since last block is always processed with separate call, |len| not being multiple of complete blocks can be observed only with |len| being less than BLAKE2S_BLOCKBYTES ("less" including even zero), which is why following assignment doesn't have to reside inside the main loop below.

blake2s_increment_counter

almost 3x reduction on x86_64, 4.5x on ARMv8, 4x on ARMv4

Absorb the input data into the hash state. Always returns 1.

Intuitively one would expect intermediate buffer, c->buf, to store incomplete blocks. But in this case we are interested to temporarily stash even complete blocks, because last one in the stream has to be treated in special way, and at this point we don't know if last block in this call is last one "ever". This is the reason for why |datalen| is compared as >, and not >=.

Fill buffer

If |datalen| is a multiple of the blocksize, stash last complete block, it can be final one...

Be lazy, do not compress

Calculate the final hash and save it in md. Always returns 1.

Padding

Output full hash to temp buffer
