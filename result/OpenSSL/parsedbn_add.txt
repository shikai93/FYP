r can == a or b

a + b a+b a + -b a-b -a + b b-a -a + -b -(a+b)

only one is negative

we are now a - b

unsigned add of b to a

unsigned subtraction of b from a, a must be larger than b.

hmm... should not be happening

a - b a-b a - -b a+b -a - b -(a+b) -a - -b b-a

We are actually doing a - b :-)
