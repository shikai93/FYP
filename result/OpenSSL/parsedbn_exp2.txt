Tables of variables obtained from 'ctx'

Build table for a1: val1[i] := a1^(2i + 1) mod m for i = 0 .. 2^(window1-1)

Build table for a2: val2[i] := a2^(2i + 1) mod m for i = 0 .. 2^(window2-1)

Now compute the power product, using independent windows.

The 'value' of the first window

The 'value' of the second window

If wvalue1 > 0, the bottom bit of the first window

If wvalue2 > 0, the bottom bit of the second window

consider bits b-window1+1 .. b for this window

works for i<0

consider bits b-window2+1 .. b for this window

wvalue1 is odd and < 2^window1

wvalue2 is odd and < 2^window2
