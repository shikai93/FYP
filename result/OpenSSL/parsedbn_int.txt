Determine the modified width-(w+1) Non-Adjacent Form (wNAF) of 'scalar'. This is an array r[] of values that are either zero or odd with an absolute value less than 2^w satisfying scalar = \sum_j r[j]2^j where at most one of any w+1 consecutive digits is non-zero with the exception that the most significant digit may be only w-1 zeros away from that next non-zero digit.

Set all words to zero

Copy the internal BIGNUM words into out which holds size elements (and size must be bigger than top)

Set the internal data words in a to point to words which contains size elements. The BN_FLG_STATIC_DATA flag is set

Copy words into the BIGNUM |a|, reallocating space as necessary. The negative flag of |a| is not modified. Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.

|num_words| is int because bn_expand2 takes an int. This is an internal function so we simply trust callers not to pass negative values.
