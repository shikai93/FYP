like BN_mod, but returns non-negative remainder (i.e., 0 <= r < |d| always holds)

now -|d| < r < 0, so we have to set r := r + |d|

BN_mod_add variant that may be used if both a and b are non-negative and less than m

BN_mod_sub variant that may be used if both a and b are non-negative and less than m

slow but works

r->neg == 0, thus we don't need BN_nnmod

BN_mod_lshift1 variant that may be used if a is non-negative and less than m

BN_mod_lshift variant that may be used if a is non-negative and less than m

0 < r < m

max_shift >= 0

BN_num_bits(r) <= BN_num_bits(m)
