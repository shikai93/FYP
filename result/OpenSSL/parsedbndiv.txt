Confirm that if (d, r) = a / b, then b d + r == a, and that sign(d) == sign(a), and 0 <= r <= b

256 kB

s1 and s2 will be the signs for b1 and b2.

limit the size of the input to avoid timeout

We are going to split the buffer in two, sizes l1 and l2, giving b1 and b2.

Use first byte to divide the remaining buffer into 3Fths. I admit this disallows some number sizes. If it matters, better ideas are welcome (Ben).

divide by 0 is an error
