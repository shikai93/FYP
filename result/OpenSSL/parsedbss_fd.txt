Dummy placeholder for BIO_s_fd...

As for unconditional usage of "UPLINK" interface in this module. Trouble is that unlike Unix file descriptors [which are indexes in kernel-side per-process table], corresponding descriptors on platforms which require "UPLINK" interface seem to be indexes in a user-land, non-global table. Well, in fact they are indexes in stdio _iob[], and recall that _iob[] was the very reason why "UPLINK" interface was introduced in first place. But one way on another. Neither libcrypto or libssl use this BIO meaning that file descriptors can only be provided by application. Therefore "UPLINK" calls are due...
