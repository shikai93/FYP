First you setup M and L parameters and pass the key schedule. This is called once per session setup...

!!! Following interfaces are to be called once per packet !!!

Then you setup per-message nonce and pass the length of the message

the L parameter

nonce is too short

clear Adata flag

Then you pass additional authentication data, this is optional

set Adata flag

Finally you encrypt or decrypt the message

counter part of nonce may not be larger than L8 bits, L is not larger than 8, therefore 64-bit counter...
