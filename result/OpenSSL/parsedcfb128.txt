The input and output encrypted as though 128bit cfb mode is being used. The extra state information to record how much of the 128bit block we have used is contained in num;

always true actually

the rest would be commonly eliminated by x86 compiler

always true actually

the rest would be commonly eliminated by x86 compiler

This expects a single block of size nbits for both in and out. Note that it corrupts any extra bits in the last byte of out

+1 because we dereference (but don't use) one byte off the end

fill in the first half of the new IV with the current IV

construct the new IV

encrypt the input

decrypt the input

shift ovec left...

it is not necessary to cleanse ovec, since the IV is not secret

N.B. This expects the input to be packed, MS bit first
