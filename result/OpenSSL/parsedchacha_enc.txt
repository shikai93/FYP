Adapted from the public domain code by D. Bernstein from SUPERCOP.

QUARTERROUND updates a, b, c, d with a ChaCha "quarter" round.

chacha_core performs 20 rounds of ChaCha on the input words in |input| and writes the 64 output bytes to |output|.

sigma constant "expand 32-byte k" in little-endian encoding

Advance 32-bit counter. Note that as subroutine is so to say nonce-agnostic, this limited counter width doesn't prevent caller from implementing wider counter. It would simply take two calls split on counter overflow...
