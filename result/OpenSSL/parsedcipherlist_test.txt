All ciphers in the DEFAULT cipherlist meet the default security level. However, default supported ciphers exclude SRP and PSK ciphersuites for which no callbacks have been set up. Supported ciphers also exclude TLSv1.2 ciphers if TLSv1.2 is disabled, and individual disabled algorithms. However, NO_RSA, NO_AES and NO_SHA are currently broken and should be considered mission impossible in libssl.
