Never detached

If content detached data goes nowhere: create NULL BIO

If content not detached and created return memory BIO

Else content was read in: return read only BIO for it

If embedded content find memory BIO and set content

Set bio as read only so its content can't be clobbered

Nothing to do

Return an OCTET STRING pointer to content. This allows it to be accessed or set later.

Return an ASN1_OBJECT pointer to content type. This allows it to be accessed or set later.

NB: special flag to show content is created and not read in.

Create a digest BIO from an X509_ALGOR structure

Locate a message digest content from a BIO chain based on SignerInfo

Look for digest type to match signature

Workaround for broken implementations that use signature algorithm OID instead of digest.
