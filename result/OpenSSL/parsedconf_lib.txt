Init a 'CONF' structure from an old LHASH

The following section contains the "CONF classic" functions, rewritten in terms of the new CONF interface.

This function does not believe in errors...

The following section contains the "New CONF" functions. They are completely centralised around a new CONF structure that may contain basically anything, but at least a method pointer and a table of data. These functions are also written in terms of the bridge functions used by the "CONF classic" functions, for consistency.

Since we may get a value from an environment variable even if conf is NULL, let's check the value first

These routines call the C malloc/free, to avoid intermixing with OpenSSL function pointers before the library is initialized.
