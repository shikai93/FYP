Trouble with Ciphertext Stealing, CTS, mode is that there is no common official specification, but couple of cipher/application specific ones: RFC2040 and RFC3962. Then there is 'Proposal to Extend CBC Mode By "Ciphertext Stealing"' at NIST site, which deviates from mentioned RFCs. Most notably it allows input to be of block length and it doesn't flip the order of the last two blocks. CTS is being discussed even in ECB context, but it's not adopted for any known application. This implementation provides two interfaces: one compliant with above mentioned RFCs and one compliant with the NIST proposal, both extending CBC mode.
