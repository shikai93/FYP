This works like d2i_PrivateKey() except it automatically works out the type

Dirty trick: read in the ASN1 data into a STACK_OF(ASN1_TYPE): by analyzing it we can determine the passed structure: this assumes the input is surrounded by an ASN1 SEQUENCE.

Since we only need to discern "traditional format" RSA and DSA keys we can just count the elements.

This seems to be PKCS8, not traditional format
