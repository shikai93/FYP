Declares the structures needed to register each test case function.

A parameterised tests runs a loop of test cases. |num_test_cases| counts the total number of test cases across all tests.

When compiled with enable-crypto-mdebug, OPENSSL_DEBUG_MEMORY=0 can be used to disable leak checking at runtime. Note this only works when running the test binary manually; the test harness always enables OPENSSL_DEBUG_MEMORY.
