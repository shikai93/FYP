The DSS routines are based on patches supplied by Steven Schoch <schoch@sheba.arc.nasa.gov>.

Does nothing. Previously this switched off constant time behaviour.

If this flag is set the DSA method is FIPS compliant and can be used in FIPS mode. This is set in the validated module method. If an application sets this flag in its own methods it is its responsibility to ensure the result is compliant.

If this flag is set the operations normally disabled in FIPS mode are permitted it is then the applications responsibility to ensure that the usage is compliant.
