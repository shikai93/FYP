BIO is freed by create_ssl_connection on error

Inject a dummy record from the next epoch. In test 0, this should never get used because the message sequence number is too big. In test 1 we set the record sequence number to be way off in the future. This should not have an impact on the record replay protection because the record should be dropped before it is marked as arrived
