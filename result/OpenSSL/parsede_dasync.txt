Engine Id and Name

Set up digests. Just SHA1 for now

SHA1

Holds the EVP_MD object for sha1 in this engine. Set up once only during engine bind and can then be reused many times.

RSA

AES

Holds the EVP_CIPHER object for aes_128_cbc in this engine. Set up once only during engine bind and can then be reused many times.

Holds the EVP_CIPHER object for aes_128_cbc_hmac_sha1 in this engine. Set up once only during engine bind and can then be reused many times.

In the Dummy async engine we are cheating. We signal that the job is complete by waking it before the call to ASYNC_pause_job(). A real async engine would only wake when the job was actually complete

Ignore errors - we carry on anyway

Clear the wake signal
