Calculates and sets the affine coordinates of an EC_POINT from the given compressed coordinates. Uses algorithm 2.3.4 of SEC 1. Note that the simple implementation only uses affine coordinates. The method is from the following publication: Harper, Menezes, Vanstone: "Public-Key Cryptosystems with Very Small Key Lengths", EUROCRYPT '92, Springer-Verlag LNCS 658, published February 1993 US Patents 6,141,420 and 6,618,483 (Vanstone, Mullin, Agnew) describe the same method, but claim no priority date earlier than July 29, 1994 (and additionally fail to cite the EUROCRYPT '92 publication as prior art).

clear error queue

Converts an EC_POINT to an octet string. If buf is NULL, the encoded length will be returned. If the length len of buf is smaller than required an error will be returned.

encodes to a single 0 octet

ret := required output buffer length

if 'buf' is NULL, just return required length

Converts an octet string representation to an EC_POINT. Note that the simple implementation only uses affine coordinates.

EC_POINT_set_affine_coordinates_GF2m is responsible for checking that the point is on the curve.
