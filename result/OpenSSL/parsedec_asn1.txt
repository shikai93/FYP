some structures needed for the asn1 encoding

NID_X9_62_onBasis

NID_X9_62_tpBasis

NID_X9_62_ppBasis

anything else

NID_X9_62_prime_field

NID_X9_62_characteristic_two_field

anything else

ECPARAMETERS

ECPKPARAMETERS

SEC1 ECPrivateKey

the OpenSSL ASN.1 definitions

some declarations of internal function

ec_asn1_group2field() sets the values in a X9_62_FIELDID object

ec_asn1_group2curve() sets the values in a X9_62_CURVE object

the function definitions

clear the old values (if necessary)

set OID for the field

the parameters are specified by the prime number p

set the prime number

set base type OID

set k? values

field_type == NID_X9_62_onBasis

for ONB the parameters are (asn1) NULL

get a and b

nid == NID_X9_62_characteristic_two_field

len_1 == 0 => a == 0

len_2 == 0 => b == 0

set a and b

set the seed (optional)

set the version (always one)

set the fieldID

set the curve

set the base point

set the order

set the cofactor (optional)

use the asn1 OID to describe the the elliptic curve parameters

we don't know the nid => ERROR

use the ECPARAMETERS structure

now extract the curve parameters a and b

get the field parameters

get the base type

create the polynomial

create the polynomial

error

create the EC_GROUP structure

we have a curve over a prime field

extract the prime number

create the EC_GROUP structure

extract seed (optional)

set the point conversion form

extract the ec point

extract the order

Hasse bound

extract the cofactor (optional)

set the generator, order and cofactor (if present)

the curve is given by an OID

the parameters are given by a ECPARAMETERS structure

implicitlyCA

EC_GROUP <-> DER encoding of ECPKPARAMETERS

some EC_KEY functions

Remember the original private-key-only encoding.

sorry, but a EC_GROUP-structure is necessary to set the public key

out == NULL => just return the length of the octet string

If the top bit is set the asn1 encoding is 1 larger.
