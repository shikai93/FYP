testing whether the pub_key is on the elliptic curve

testing whether pub_key order is the point at infinity

in case the priv_key is present : check if generator priv_key == pub_key

Check if retrieved coordinates match originals and are less than field order: if not values are out of range.

Save the point conversion form. For non-custom curves the first octet of the buffer (excluding the last significant bit) contains the point conversion form. EC_POINT_oct2point() has already performed sanity checking of the buffer so we know it is valid.

Octetstring may need leading zeros if BN is to short
