functions for EC_GROUP objects

Copy precomputed

src->generator == NULL

src->generator == NULL

Some groups have an order with factors of two, which makes the Montgomery setup fail. |group->mont_data| will be NULL in this case.

compare the field types

compare the curve name (if present in both)

XXX This approach assumes that the external representation of curves over the same field type is the same.

XXX EC_POINT_cmp() assumes that the methods are equal

compare the order and cofactor

functions for EC_POINT objects

Check whether an EC_POINT is on the curve or not. Note that the return value for this function should NOT be treated as a boolean. Return values: 1: The point is on the curve 0: The point is not on the curve -1: An error occurred

Functions for point multiplication. If group->meth->mul is 0, we use the wNAF-based implementations in ec_mult.c; otherwise we dispatch through methods.

use default

just a convenient interface to EC_POINTs_mul()

use default

nothing to do, so report success

use default

cannot tell whether precomputation has been performed

ec_precompute_mont_data sets |group->mont_data| from |group->order| and returns one on success. On error it returns zero.
