EC pkey context structure

Key and paramgen group

message digest

Duplicate key if custom cofactor needed

Cofactor mode

KDF (if any) to use for ECDH

Message digest to use for key derivation

User key material

KDF output length

NB: unlike PKCS#3 DH, if outlen is less than maximum size this is not an error, the result is truncated.

Do KDF stuff

If cofactor is 1 cofactor mode does nothing

Default behaviour is OK

Note: if error return, pkey is freed by parent routine
