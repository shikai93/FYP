clear error queue

Recover y. We have a Weierstrass equation y^2 = x^3 + ax + b, so y is one of the square roots of x^3 + ax + b.

tmp1 := x^3

field_{sqr,mul} work on standard representation

tmp1 := tmp1 + ax

field_mul works on standard representation

tmp1 := tmp1 + b

BN_mod_sqrt() should have cought this error (not a square)

encodes to a single 0 octet

ret := required output buffer length

if 'buf' is NULL, just return required length

EC_POINT_set_affine_coordinates_GFp is responsible for checking that the point is on the curve.
