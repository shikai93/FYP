Perform a deterministic walk on the curve, by starting from |point| and using the X-coordinate of the previous point as the next scalar for point multiplication. Returns the X-coordinate of the end result or NULL on error.

We currently hard-code P-256, though adaptation to other curves. would be straightforward.

Stress test the curve. If the '-num' argument is given, runs the loop |num| times and prints the resulting X-coordinate. Otherwise runs the test the default number of times and compares against the expected result.

TODO(openssl-team): code under test/ should be able to reuse the option parsing framework currently in apps/.
