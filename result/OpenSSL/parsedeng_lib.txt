The "new"/"free" stuff first

Placed here (close proximity to ENGINE_new) so that modifications to the elements of the ENGINE structure are more likely to be caught and changed here.

Free up any dynamically allocated public key methods

Give the ENGINE a chance to do any structural cleanup corresponding to allocation it did in its constructor (eg. unload error strings)

Cleanup stuff

engine_cleanup_int() is coded such that anything that does work that will need cleanup can register a "cleanup" callback here. That way we don't get linker bloat by referring to all possible cleanups, but any linker bloat into code "X" will cause X's cleanup function to end up here.

The API function that performs all cleanup

Now the "ex_data" support

Functions to get/set an ENGINE's elements - mainly to avoid exposing the ENGINE structure itself.

eng_lib.o is pretty much linked into anything that touches ENGINE already, so put the "static_state" hack here.
