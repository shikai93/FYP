The new form of this macro (check if the ab == 0) was suggested by Colin Plumb <colin@nyx10.cs.du.edu>

Removal of the inner if from from Wei Dai 24/4/96

assuming a or b is 0 and in range

7/12/95 - Many thanks to Rhys Weatherley <rweather@us.oracle.com> for pointing out that I was assuming little endian byte order for all quantities what idea actually used bigendian. No where in the spec does it mention this, it is all in terms of 16 bit numbers and even the example does not use byte streams for the input example :-(. If you byte swap each pair of input, keys and iv, the functions would produce the output as the old version :-(.
