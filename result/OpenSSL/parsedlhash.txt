'lh->error++' already done in 'expand'

replace same key

reverse the order so we search from 'top to bottom' We were having memory leaks otherwise

move it

fputs("realloc error in lhash",stderr);

The following hash seems to work very well on normal text strings no collisions on /usr/dict/words and it distributes on %2^n quite well, not as good as MD5, but still good.

Header for dynamic hash table routines Author - Eric Young

Macros for declaring and implementing type-safe wrappers for LHASH callbacks. This way, callbacks can be provided to LHASH structures without function pointer casting and the macro-defined callbacks provide per-variable casting before deferring to the underlying type-specific callbacks. NB: It is possible to place a "static" in front of both the DECLARE and IMPLEMENT macros if the functions are strictly internal.

First: "hash" functions

Second: "compare" functions

Fourth: "doall_arg" functions

Type checking...
