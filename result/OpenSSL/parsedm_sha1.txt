SSLv3 client auth handling: see RFC-6101 5.6.8

At this point hash contains all handshake messages, update with master secret and pad_1.

Set padtmp to pad_1 value

Reinitialise context

Set padtmp to pad_2 value

Now when ctx is finalised it will return the SSL v3 hash value

Even though there're separate SHA224_[Update|Final], we call SHA256 functions even in SHA224 context. This is what happens there anyway, so we can spare few CPU cycles:-)
