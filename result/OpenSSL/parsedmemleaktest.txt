We use a proper main function here instead of the custom main from the test framework because the CRYPTO_mem_leaks_fp function cannot be called a second time without trying to use a null pointer. The test framework calls this function as part of its close down. A work around is to call putenv("OPENSSL_DEBUG_MEMORY=0"); before exiting but that is worse than avoiding the test framework's main.
