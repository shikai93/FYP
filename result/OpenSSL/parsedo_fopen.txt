Basically there are three cases to cover: a) filename is pure ASCII string; b) actual UTF-8 encoded string and c) locale-ized string, i.e. one containing 8-bit characters that are meaningful in current system locale. If filename is pure ASCII or real UTF-8 encoded string, MultiByteToWideChar succeeds and _wfopen works. If filename is locale-ized string, chances are that MultiByteToWideChar fails reporting ERROR_NO_UNICODE_TRANSLATION, in which case we fall back to fopen...

UTF-8 decode succeeded, but no file, filename could still have been locale-ized...
