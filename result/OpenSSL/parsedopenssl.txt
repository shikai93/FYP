Needed to get the other O_xxx flags.

Structure to hold the number of columns to be displayed and the field width used to display them.

Special sentinel to exit the program.

The LHASH callbacks ("hash" & "cmp") have been replaced by functions with the base prototypes (we cast each variable inside the function to the required type of "FUNCTION"). This removes the necessity for macro-generated wrapper functions.

Set non-default library initialisation settings

Set up some of the environment.

Replace argv[] with UTF-8 encoded strings.

first check the program name

If there is stuff on the command line, run with that.

ok, lets enter interactive mode

Read a line, continue reading if line ends with \

If there is help, list what flags are not documented.

If not aliased to the dgst command,

Unified enum for help and list commands.

Never hit, but suppresses warning

User is asking if foo is unsupported, by trying to "run" the no-foo command. Strange.

Special value to mean "exit the program.

Sort alphabetically within category. For nicer help displays.
