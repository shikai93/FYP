Simplified PKCS#12 routines

Parse and decrypt a PKCS#12 structure returning user key, user cert and other (CA) certs. Note either ca should be NULL, ca should be NULL, or it should point to a valid STACK structure. pkey and cert can be passed uninitialised.

Check for NULL PKCS12 structure

Check the mac

If password is zero length or NULL then try verifying both cases to determine which password is correct. The reason for this is that under PKCS#12 password based encryption no password and a zero length password are two different things...

Allocate stack for other certificates

Parse the outer PKCS#12 structure
