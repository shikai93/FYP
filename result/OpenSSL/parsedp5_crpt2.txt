#define OPENSSL_DEBUG_PKCS5V2

This is an implementation of PKCS#5 v2.0 password based encryption key derivation function PBKDF2. SHA1 version verified against test vectors posted by Peter Gutmann <pgut001@cs.auckland.ac.nz> to the PKCS-TNG <pkcs-tng@rsa.com> mailing list.

We are unlikely to ever use more than 256 blocks (5120 bits!) but just in case...

Now the key derivation function itself. This is a bit evil because it has to check the ASN1 parameters are valid: and there are quite a few of them...

See if we recognise the key derivation function

lets see if we recognise the encryption algorithm.

Fixup cipher based on AlgorithmIdentifier

Decode parameter

Now check the parameters of the kdf

it seems that its all OK
