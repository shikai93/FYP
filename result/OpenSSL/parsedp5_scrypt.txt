PKCS#5 scrypt password based encryption structures

Return an algorithm identifier for a PKCS#5 v2.0 PBE algorithm using scrypt

Setup the AlgorithmIdentifier for the encryption scheme

Create random IV

Dummy cipherinit to just setup the IV

If its RC2 then we'd better setup the key length

Setup keyfunc

Now set up top level AlgorithmIdentifier

Encode PBE2PARAM into parameter

This will either copy salt or grow the buffer

If have a key len set it up

Finally setup the keyfunc structure

Encode SCRYPT_PARAMS into parameter of pbe2

Decode parameter

Now check the parameters of sparam

Check all parameters fit in uint64_t and are acceptable to scrypt

it seems that its all OK
