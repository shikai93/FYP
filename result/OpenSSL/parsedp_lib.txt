Compare parameters if the algorithm has them

Setup a public key ASN1 method and ENGINE from a NID or a string. If pkey is NULL just return 1 or 0 if the algorithm exists.

If key type matches and a method exists then this lookup has succeeded once so just indicate success.

If we have an ENGINE release it

internal function; x is never NULL
