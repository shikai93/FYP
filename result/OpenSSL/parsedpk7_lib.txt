NOTE(emilia): does not support detached digested data.

PKCS7_content_free(p7);

will not fail

If the digest is not currently listed, add it

we need to add another algorithm

We now need to add another PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO entry

because ASN1_INTEGER_set is used to set a 'long' we will do things the ugly way.

lets keep the pkey around for a while

Set the algorithms

Check cipher OID exists and has data in it
