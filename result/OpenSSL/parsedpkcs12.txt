To avoid bit rot

Load in all certs in input file

Look for matching private key

Zero keyid and alias

Remove from list

Add any more certificates asked for

If chaining get chain from user cert

Exclude verified certificate

Free first certificate

Add any CA names

To avoid bit rot

current hash algorithms do not use parameters so extract just name, in future alg_print() may be needed

If we enter empty password try no password first

If mac and crypto pass the same set it to NULL too

May be UTF8 from previous version of OpenSSL: convert to a UTF8 form which will translate to the same Unicode password.

Given a single certificate return a verified chain or NULL if error

If PBE algorithm is PBES2 decode algorithm parameters for additional details.

If KDF is PBKDF2 decode parameters

Load all certificates from a given file

Generalised attribute print: handle PKCS#8 and bag attributes
