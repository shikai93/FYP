ran@cryptocom.ru: For clarity. The error is if parameters in peer are present (!missing) but don't match. EVP_PKEY_cmp_parameters may return 1 (match), 0 (don't match) and -2 (comparison is not defined). -1 (different key types) is impossible here because it is checked earlier. -2 is OK for us here, as well as 1, so we can check for 0 only.
