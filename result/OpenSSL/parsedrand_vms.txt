Use 32-bit pointers almost everywhere. Define the type to which to cast a pointer passed to an external function.

length is number of bytes

determine the number of items in the JPI array

Create the JPI itemlist array to hold item_data content

8 bytes per entry max

Setup itemlist for GETJPI

total_length is in longwords

Fill data_buffer with various info bits from this process

Now twist that data to seed the SSL random number init

for JPI$_FINALEXC

OK to use rand() just to scramble the seed

OK to use rand() just to scramble the seed

size of seed is total_length4 bytes (64bytes)
