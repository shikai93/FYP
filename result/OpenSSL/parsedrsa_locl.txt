The first parameter is used to pickup errors where this is passed instead of aEVP_PKEY, it is set to 0

functional reference if 'meth' is ENGINE-provided

If a PSS only key this contains the parameter restrictions

be careful using this if the RSA structure is shared

Used to cache montgomery values

all BIGNUM values are actually in the following data, if it is not NULL

Can be null

may be needed!

New sign and verify functions: some libraries don't allow arbitrary data to be signed/verified: this allows them to be used. Note: for this to work the RSA_public_decrypt() and RSA_private_encrypt() should NOT be used RSA_sign(), RSA_verify() should be used instead.

If this callback is NULL, the builtin software RSA key-gen will be used. This is for behavioural compatibility whilst the code gets rewired, but one day it would be nice to assume there are no such things as "builtin software" implementations.
