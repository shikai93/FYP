Negative sLen has special meanings: -1 sLen == hLen -2 salt length is autorecovered from signature -3 salt length is maximized -N reserved

sLen can be small negative

Negative sLen has special meanings: -1 sLen == hLen -2 salt length is maximized -3 same as above (on signing) -N reserved

Generate dbMask in place then perform XOR on it

Initial PS XORs with all zeroes which is a NOP so just update pointer. Note from a test above this value is guaranteed to be non-negative.

H is already in place so just set final 0xbc
