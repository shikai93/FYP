X9.31 RSA key derivation and generation

If not all parameters present only calculate what we can. This allows test programs to output selective parameters.

Since both primes are set we can now calculate all remaining components.

calculate n

calculate d

p-1

q-1

(p-1)(q-1)

LCM((p-1)(q-1))

d

calculate d mod (p-1)

calculate d mod (q-1)

calculate inverse of q mod p

Generate two primes from Xp, Xq

Since rsa->p and rsa->q are valid this call will just derive remaining RSA components.
