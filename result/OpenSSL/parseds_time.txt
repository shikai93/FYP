#define TEST_CERT "client.pem"

Define a HTTP get command globally. Also define the size of the command, this is two bytes less than the size of the string because the %s is replaced by the URL.

Loop and time how long it takes to make connections

Add the time for this iteration

Now loop and time connections using the same session id over and over

Get an SSL object so we can reuse the session id

Add the time for this iteration

doConnection - make a connection

ok, lets connect

Note: under VMS with SOCKETSHR the 2nd parameter is currently of type (int ) whereas under other systems it is (void ) if you don't have a cast it will choke the compiler: if you do have a cast then you can either go for (int ) or (void ).
