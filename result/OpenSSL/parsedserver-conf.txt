A minimal program to serve an SSL connection. It uses blocking. It uses the SSL_CONF API with a configuration file. cc -I../../include saccept.c -L../.. -lssl -lcrypto -ldl

Setup server side SSL bio

This means that when a new connection is accepted on 'in', The ssl_bio will be 'duplicated' and have the new socket BIO push into it. Basically it means the SSL BIO will be automatically setup

The first call will setup the accept socket, and the second will get a socket. In this loop, the first actual accept will occur in the BIO_read() function.

If we have finished, remove the underlying BIO stack so the next time we call any function for this BIO, it will attempt to do an accept
