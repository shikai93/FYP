winsock[2].h was included already?

this is used to be wcecompat/include/winsock_extras.h

Even though sizeof(SOCKET) is 8, it's safe to cast it to int, because the value constitutes an index in per-process table of limited size and not a real pointer. And we also depend on fact that all processors Windows run on happen to be two's-complement, which allows to interchange INVALID_SOCKET and -1.

FIONBIO in some SVR4, e.g. unixware, solaris

ioctl is only in VMS > 7.0 and when socketshr is not used

Some IPv6 implementations are broken, disable them in known bad versions.
