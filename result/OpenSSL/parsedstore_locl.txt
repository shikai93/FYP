EMBEDDED is a special type of OSSL_STORE_INFO, specially for the file handlers. It should never reach a calling application or any engine. However, it can be used by a FILE_HANDLER's try_decode function to signal that it has decoded the incoming blob into a new blob, and that the attempted decoding should be immediately restarted with the new blob, using the new PEM name.

Because this is an internal type, we don't make it public.
