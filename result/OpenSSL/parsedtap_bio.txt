Output a string to the specified bio and return 1 if successful.

Write some data. This function implements a simple state machine that detects new lines. It indents the output and prefixes it with a '#' character. It returns the number of input characters that were output in in_size. More characters than this will likely have been output however any calling code will be unable to correctly assess the actual number of characters emitted and would be prone to failure if the actual number were returned. The BIO_data field is used as our state. If it is NULL, we've just seen a new line. If it is not NULL, we're processing characters in a line.
