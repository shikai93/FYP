If this symbol is defined then ENGINE_get_pkey_asn1_meth_engine(), the function that is used by EVP to hook in pkey_asn1_meth code and cache defaults (etc), will display brief debugging summaries to stderr with the 'nid'.

#define ENGINE_PKEY_ASN1_METH_DEBUG

Exposed API function to get a functional reference from the implementation table (ie. try to get a functional reference from the tabled structural references) for a given pkey_asn1_meth 'nid'

Obtains a pkey_asn1_meth implementation from an ENGINE functional reference

Gets the pkey_asn1_meth callback from an ENGINE structure

Sets the pkey_asn1_meth callback in an ENGINE structure

Internal function to free up EVP_PKEY_ASN1_METHOD structures before an ENGINE is destroyed

Find a method based on a string. This does a linear search through all implemented algorithms. This is OK in practice because only a small number of algorithms are likely to be implemented in an engine and it is not used for speed critical operations.

If found obtain a structural reference to engine
