All the functions return 1 or non-NULL for success and 0 or NULL for failure

Open whatever channel for this, be it the console, an X window or whatever. This function should use the ex_data structure to save intermediate data.

Flush the output. If a GUI dialog box is used, this function can be used to actually display it.

Duplicate the ui_data that often comes alongside a ui_method. This allows some backends to save away UI information for later use.

Construct a prompt in a user-defined manner. object_desc is a textual short description of the object, for example "pass phrase", and object_name is the name of the object (might be a card name or a file name. The returned string shall always be allocated on the heap with OPENSSL_malloc(), and need to be free'd with OPENSSL_free().

UI_METHOD specific application data.

Flags from the user

The following parameters are completely irrelevant for UIT_INFO, and can therefore be set to 0 or NULL

Input and Output: If not NULL, user-defined with size in result_maxsize. Otherwise, it may be allocated by the UI routine, meaning result_minsize is going to be overwritten.

Input: minimum required size of the result.

Input: maximum permitted size of the result

Input: test string to verify against
