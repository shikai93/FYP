Maybe fix this: it is supported now

Append subject altname of issuer to issuer alt name of subject

Copy any email addresses in a certificate or request to GENERAL_NAMES

Find the subject name

Now add any email address(es) to STACK

Free this up because we will overwrite it. no need to free type_id because it is static

FIXME: should allow other character types...
