Support for Thawte strong extranet extension

NBB: this is used for testing only. It should not be used for anything else because it will just take static IDs from the configuration file and they should really be separate values for each user.

Strong Extranet utility functions

Add an id given the zone as an ASCII number

Add an id given the zone as an unsigned long

Add an id given the zone as an ASN1_INTEGER. Note this version uses the passed integer and doesn't make a copy so don't free it up afterwards.
