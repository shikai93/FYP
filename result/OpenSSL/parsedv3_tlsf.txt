i2v_TLS_FEATURE converts the TLS_FEATURE structure tls_feature into the STACK_OF(CONF_VALUE) structure ext_list. STACK_OF(CONF_VALUE) is the format used by the CONF library to represent a multi-valued extension. ext_list is returned.

v2i_TLS_FEATURE converts the multi-valued extension nval into a TLS_FEATURE structure, which is returned if the conversion is successful. In case of error, NULL is returned.
