trust setting to check

Verify depth

Security level for chain verification

Permissible policies

Peer identity details

Set of acceptable names

Flags to control matching features

Matching hostname in peer certificate

If not NULL email address to match

If not NULL IP address to match

Method to handle CRL access. In general a CRL could be very large (several Mb) and can consume large amounts of resources if stored in memory by multiple processes. This method allows general CRL operations to be redirected to more efficient callbacks: for example a CRL entry database.

This is used to hold everything. It is used for all certificate validation. Once we have a certificate chain, the 'verify' function is then called to actually check the cert chain.

if true, stash any hits

Cache of all objects

These are external lookup methods
