No idea

It seems several organisations had the same idea of including a list of extensions in a certificate request. There are at least two OIDs that are used and there may be more: so the list is configurable.

Add a STACK_OF extensions to a certificate request: allow alternative OIDs in case we want to create a non standard one.

Generate encoding of extensions

This is the normal usage: use the "official" OID
