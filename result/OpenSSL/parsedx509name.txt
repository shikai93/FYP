NOTE: you should be passing -1, not 0 as lastpos

else we need to fixup the set field

set_prev is the previous set set is the current set set_next is the following prev 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 set 1 1 2 2 next 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 2 so basically only if prev and next differ by 2, then re-number down by 1

if set is -1, append to previous set, 0 'a new one', and 1, prepend to the guy we are about to stomp on.

if (set >= 0)

X509_NAME_ENTRY_dup is ASN1 generated code, that can't be easily const'ified; harmless cast as dup() don't modify its input.
