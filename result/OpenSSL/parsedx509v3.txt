Useful typedefs

V3 extension structure

If this is set the following four fields are ignored

Old style ASN1 calls

The following pair is used for string extensions

The following pair is used for multi-valued extensions

The following are used for raw extensions

Any extension specific data

Context specific info

Maybe more here

ext_flags values

otherName

Old names

iPAddress

dirn

rfc822Name, dNSName, uniformResourceIdentifier

registeredID

x400Address

If relativename then this contains the full distribution point name

All existing reasons

Strong extranet structures

Proxy certificate structures, see RFC 3820

Values in idp_flags field

IDP present

IDP values inconsistent

onlyuser true

onlyCA true

onlyattr true

indirectCRL true

onlysomereasons present

X509_PURPOSE stuff

Really self issued not necessarily self signed

EXFLAG_SET is set to indicate that some values have been precomputed

Self signed

Default trust ID

Flags for X509V3_EXT_print()

Return error for unknown extensions

Print error for unknown extensions

ASN1 parse unknown extensions

BIO_dump unknown extensions

Flags for X509V3_add1_i2d

The new declarations are in crypto.h, but the old ones were here.

Flags for X509_check_ functions

Always check subject name for host match even if subject alt names present

Disable wildcard matching for dnsName fields and common name.

Wildcards must not match a partial label.

Allow (non-partial) wildcards to match multiple labels.

Constraint verifier subdomain patterns to match a single labels.

Never check the subject CN

Match reference identifiers starting with "." to any sub-domain. This is a non-public flag, turned on implicitly when the subject reference identity is a DNS name.

API tag for elements of the ASIdentifer SEQUENCE.

AFI values, assigned by IANA. It'd be nice to make the AFI handling code totally generic, but there are too many little things that would need to be defined for other address families for it to be worth the trouble.

Utilities to construct and extract values from RFC3779 extensions, since some of the encodings (particularly for IP address prefixes and ranges) are a bit tedious to work with directly.

Canonical forms.

Tests for inheritance and containment.

Check whether RFC 3779 extensions nest properly in chains.
