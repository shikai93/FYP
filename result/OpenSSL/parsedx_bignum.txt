Custom primitive type for BIGNUM handling. This reads in an ASN1_INTEGER as a BIGNUM directly. Currently it ignores the sign which isn't a problem since all BIGNUMs used are non negative and anything that looks negative is normally due to an encoding error.

If MSB set in an octet we need a padding byte
